## Project Overview

Hospital readmission within 30 days is one of the most costly and preventable problems in modern healthcare. In the U.S., preventable readmissions cost an estimated **$26 billion annually**, and hospitals face penalties under Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRRP) for excessive rates.

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to **predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30days of discharge**, using clinical and administrative data routinely collected during hospital stays.

### Research Question
> *Can we accurately predict 30-day hospital readmission in diabetic patients using routine clinical data - and which patient features drive that risk most strongly?*

### 🎯 Research Question
> *Can we accurately predict 30-day hospital readmission in diabetic patients using routine clinical data - and which patient features drive that risk most strongly?*

## Key Findings
 - Logistic Regression achieved **ROC-AUC ≈ 0.68** with **Recall ≈ 0.37** at threshold 0.35
 - ***Prior inpatient visits* and **number of medications** are the strongest predictors
 - Only **11.2%** of encounters result in early readmission - severe class imbalance requiring SMOTE
 - Middle-aged groups (40-60) have **higher** early readmission rates than the elderly - counter-intuitive and clinically meaningful
 - LR was chosen for its **interpretability** - critical in healthcare where clinicians need to understand why a patient is flagged.

## Data Cleaning

Handled in `diabetes_hospital_readmission_cleaning.py`. Files required `diabetic_data.csv` + `IDS_mapping.csv`. Outputs `diabetic_cleaned.csv`.
 
| Step | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Replace `?` with `NaN` | Missing values encoded as `?` not standard NaN |
| 2 | Drop `weight` | 96.9% missing — unusable |
| 3 | Drop `encounter_id`, `patient_nbr` | ID columns, no predictive value |
| 4 | Remove discharge = 11 | Deceased patients — readmission meaningless |
| 5 | Remove `Unknown/Invalid` gender | 3 records, introduces noise |
| 6 | Fill `race`, `medical_specialty`, `payer_code` → `"Unknown"` | Preserve records |
| 7 | Fill `diag_1/2/3` → `"0"` | Indicate missing diagnosis code |
| 8 | Binarize target: `<30` → 1, else → 0 | Binary classification framing |
| 9 | Map age brackets → numeric midpoints | Enable as continuous feature |
| 10 | Convert numeric columns | Correct dtypes for modelling |
 
**Before:** 101,766 rows × 50 columns → **After:** ~100,000 rows × 49 columns

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
 
### Plotly Visuals ( `diabetes_plotly_visualizations.py`)
 
**Visual 1 - Readmission Rate by Age Group**
 
![V1](images/ReadmissionRateByAgeGroup(PlotlyV1).png)

Middle-aged groups (40 - 60) show higher early readmission rates than the elderly - likely because older patients receive more intensive post-discharge coordination. Age is an important ML feature.
 
---

**Visual 2 - Medications by Readmission Status**
 
![V2](images/MedicationsByReadmissionStatus(PlotlyV2).png)
 
Patients readmitted within 30 days carry a higher median medication count (~18 vs ~15), reflecting greater disease complexity. `num_medications` is a strong LR predictor.
 
---

**Visual 3 - Readmission Outcome by Insulin Usage**
 
![V3](images/ReadmissionOutcomeByInsulinUsage(plotlyV3).png)
 
Patients with upward insulin dose adjustments show a higher proportion of early readmissions - signalling worsening glycaemic control during the encounter.
 
---

### Tableau Visuals

Tableau Public Link - https://public.tableau.com/views/DiabetesReadmitVisuals/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link 
 
**Visual 4 - Readmission Rate by Hospital Stay Length and Diagnosis Count**
 
![V4](images/ReadmissionRateByHospitalStayLengthAndDiagnosisCount(TableauV4).png)
 
High stay length combined with high diagnosis count produces the darkest readmission risk cells - combined clinical complexity is a stronger predictor than either feature alone.
 
---
 
**Visual 5 - Top 10 Medical Specialties by Early Readmission Rate**
 
![V5](images/Top10MedicalSpecialtiesbyEarlyReadmissionRate(TableauV5).png)
 
Certain specialties show systematically higher early readmission rates, suggesting they treat higher-acuity patients or have gaps in discharge planning protocols.
 
---
 
**Visual 6 - Readmission Outcomes by Patient Race**
 
![V6](images/ReadmissionOutcomesbyPatientRace(TableauV6).png)
 
Demographic disparities in early readmission proportions are visible across racial groups — an equity consideration for any clinical deployment of the model.

### Power BI Visuals
 
**Visual 7 - Readmission Rate by Admission Source and Type**
 
![V7](images/ReadmissionRateByAdmissionSource&Type(PowerBIV7).png)
 
Emergency admissions show the highest early readmission rates - admission context is a meaningful predictor.
 
---
 
**Visual 8 - Lab Procedure Intensity vs Readmission Rate**
 
![V8](images/LabProcedureIntensityVsReadmissionRate(PowerBIV8).png)
 
Higher lab procedure counts correlate with increased readmission risk - reflecting greater diagnostic workup for more severely ill patients.
 
---
 
**Visual 9 - Clinical Complexity: Hospital Stay vs Diagnosis Count**
 
![V9](images/ClinicalComplexity:HospitalStayVsDiagnosisCount(PowerBIV9).png)
 
The combined complexity marker of stay length and diagnosis count predicts readmission risk - consistent with the Tableau heatmap finding.

## Machine Learning
 
All ML logic is inside `streamlit-app-logistic-regressions.py`. It trains directly from `diabetic_cleaned.csv` every time the app loads, cached with `@st.cache_data`.

### Why Logistic Regression?
 
LR coefficients directly explain which features increase or decrease readmission probability - in healthcare, clinicians need to understand *why* a patient is flagged, not just *that* they are. LR provides that transparency without sacrificing meaningful performance.

### Modeling Approach
 
```
diabetic_cleaned.csv
        │
        ▼
Stratified split: 70% train | 10% validation | 20% test
        │
        ▼
SMOTE on training set ONLY → balanced 50/50 classes (no leakage)
        │
        ▼
StandardScaler fitted on train only → applied to val and test
        │
        ▼
Logistic Regression (C=0.1, class_weight='balanced', max_iter=1000)
        │
        ├── Threshold sweep on validation: 0.10 / 0.25 / 0.35 / 0.50
        │   Chosen: 0.35 (maximises recall, improves precision)
        │
        └── Final evaluation on untouched test set
            + 5-fold stratified cross-validation for stability
```
